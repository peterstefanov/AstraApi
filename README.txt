 ## NOTES 
  ASTRA API is a public API that can be used with Unity. This Api provides the ability of multi - agent system to be integrated within Unity along with the option to externalized the AI out of Unity. Support of three types of event - position, collision and messaging.
 ## USAGE
 Unity game Object is bound to an ASTRA agent and the agent allow the Game Object in terms of Unity environment to be fully autonomous. In other words ASTRA Agent attached to it take care of all decision of movement and collisions when occur.
 ## PREREQUSITES 
 ASTRA - http://astralanguage.com/wordpress/docs/introduction-to-agentspeakl/
ASTRA is an Agent Programming Language for people who wish to create intelligent distributed/concurrent systems that are built on the Java platform. It is designed to be easy to learn and familiar to developers who are experienced in using mainstream Object-Oriented Programming Languages.
AgentSpeak(L) is an agent programming language, that is based on Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) theory. This theory models rational decision making as a process of state manipulation. The idea is that the current state of the world can be represented as a set of beliefs (basically facts about the state of the world) and the ideal state of the world can be represented as a set of desires. The theory then maps out how a rational decision maker achieves its desires â€“ that is, how it changes the world so that its desires become its beliefs.
 IKVM.NET - https://www.ikvm.net/index.html
As ASTRA language compiles to Java and Unity engine runs as a .NET platform IKVM.NET was used for converting ASTRA Api to dll libraries.
IKVM.NET is useful for several different software development scenarios. Here is a sampling of some of the possibilities.
Drop-in JVM
Use Java libraries in your .NET applications
Develop .NET applications in Java
